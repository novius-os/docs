      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This style guide is intended for all persons writing copy for Novius OS: applications developers and designers, contributors to the core, translators. It establishes guidelines common to all applications and languages in order to <strong>provide every Novius OS user with consistent and enjoyable copy</strong>.</p>
      <p>This guide is based on Aaron Walter's <a href="http://aarronwalter.com/design-personas/" target="_blank">design personas</a>. MailChimp's <a href="http://voiceandtone.com" target="_blank">Voice and Tone</a> guide, created by Walter's team, has also been a source of inspiration.</p>
      
      <h3>About translation</h3>
      <p>Translation is more than just a word-to-word job. One must remain faithful to the original design while adapting it for a new audience, for a different culture. A literal translation of Novius OS copy does not make sense. The translation must read as if the copy had originally been written in the target language.<br />
      The first document to translate are these guidelines so that a <strong>localised style guide</strong> is available.</p>
      
      <h2>Voice and tone</h2>
      <p>Novius OS is <strong>designed for professionals</strong>. They don't use it for fun, they have a job to do. Novius OS must show its users they share a common goal: to get the job done as efficiently as possible. Novius OS therefore adopts a professional and straight-to-the-point tone.</p>
      <p>This said, <strong>using Novius OS doesn't have to be boring</strong>. The usual flavourless software speech (e.g. Please enter a valid value) is to be avoided. We don't Novius OS to be seen as yet another tool.</p>
      <p>Novius OS can make its users smile&mdash;especially when they succeeded in carrying out their job&mdash;but not laugh. The software is not their friend. It is rather <strong>a trustworthy and knowledgeable colleague they're happy to work with</strong>. A team of colleagues actually, as Novius OS says &lsquo;We&rsquo; not &lsquo;I&rsquo;.</p>
      <p>Finally, although many Novius OS followers are developers, copy must be jargon-free. What's more, bro-ish tone (e.g Sorry dude, I screwed up!) is inappropriate.</p>
